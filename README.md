# spinach-cpp - an attempt to spin-off Spinach in C++

[Spinach](https://github.com/IlyaKuprov/Spinach) is a spin dynamics simulation package that covers the whole of magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging.

Spinach requires Matlab and multiple toolboxes.

`spinach-cpp` relies on
- [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/index.html)
- [root](https://github.com/root-project/root)

`spinach-cpp` will use
- [FFTW](http://www.fftw.org)

We'll see how far I'll go in understanding `Spinach`...

I started from [Spinach's tutorials](https://github.com/IlyaKuprov/Spinach/tree/main/examples/tutorials)

and implemented  
    - [Getting started with NMR simulations - Describing a single quantum system](https://github.com/IlyaKuprov/Spinach/blob/main/examples/tutorials/getting_started_with_sims.pdf)

For details see `README` in [`examples/tutorials`](examples/tutorials) directory.
